            <editorialDecl>No author can be assigned to the story due to it being an oral tradition; The decision was taken to treat notes the same as a glossary in terms of coding</editorialDecl>
            <projectDesc>The project focuses on digitising oral folktales from Ghana, specifically the Konkomba people, through different media.
                The project puts a body of oral folktales into writing and eventually makes them available as annotated, digitised narratives.
                It thus aims to make a contribution to visibilising this culture, which through processes of colonisation, the accompanying priviledging of written/print culture and Eurocentric/Western thinking has been marginalised.</projectDesc>

                <head type="subTitle">Introduction</head>
                <p>The following story is one of many, in Konkomba folklore, that seek to offer insights into why a python’s skin is multi-colored. 
                    In this story, the storyteller relates the costly friendship between a python and fire, which ultimately results in the former’s house being gutted by fire,
                     forcing him to flee to the riverside. Worst of all, the fire incident leaves the python forever scarred and multi-colored. </p>

    <item><gloss xml:id="Note1"> It is common practice in Konkomba culture for close friends, especially the youth, to share meals regularly.
         The practice is often a mark of the depth of a friendship as close pals will usually visit each other’s houses and eat together as part of the things they do together.
         It’s a symbol of trust between two or more friends, and also feeds into the Konkomba communal living spirit as this practice ultimately unites the families of friends.</gloss></item>
    <label>2.</label>
    <item> <gloss xml:id="Note2">This line is a truncation of the Likpakpaln interrogative clause, <q>Ki cha la ki ni kuur kina?</q> (transliterated as <q>Where to, when it’s so dry?</q>).
         But it can be translated in this context as <q>Where am I going in this dry weather/season?</q> Note that the phrase, <q>Ki cha la</q> is non-subject specific. 
         The subject is only determined contextually.
        As a result, in other contexts, the phrase could be translated variously as: <q>Where are you going?</q> / <q>Where is he/she/it going?</q> / <q>Where are we going?</q> etc. </gloss></item>
        <label>3.</label>
        <item><gloss xml:id="Note3">In Konkomba culture, this <q>welcoming</q> will often commence with the offering of water, after which kola nuts, tobacco, or a local drink called pito can be offered – depending on the guest’s preference or what is available.
             After this, food can then be served. The guest will either eat together (from the same bowl) with one of the host’s children or with the host, if they have a close relationship (e.g., as friends or relatives). 
            The former case (i.e., a child of the host eating together with the guest) is known in Likpakpaln as lisambichuu /lisaˈmbitsu:/ (transliterated as <q>the act of holding a bowl</q>).</gloss> </item>
        <label>4.</label>
        <item> <gloss xml:id="Note4"> Here, the correction effected by one of Wumbein’ s audience points to the fact that even though the individual Konkomba (KKB) storyteller has the liberty to select, add, and/or omit certain details in a tale, the audience can still serve as checks and balances on the veracity of his/her details.
             This underscores the communal ownership and policing of the development of tales among KKB communities.
             However, individual storytellers can always agree or object to and defend any detail or details that are contested by their audience.</gloss> </item>

        <item> <gloss xml:id="gloss2">a round room that serves as the main entrance to a typical Konkomba house. It has two doors at both ends to serve as the passage in or out of a house.
             It also serves as a place for relaxing or hosting visitors/guests.
              In ubɔr’s palace, kinakuɔk usually has a stage or a raised platform where ubɔr sits to hold meetings and perform other functions.
               Thus, kinakuɔk can assume political significance rather than being a mere passage or a place for hanging out or playing host to visitors.
                Within this political context, kinakuɔk can be used as a synonym or a metonym (in literary speech) for ubɔr or the authority of ubɔr. 
            It is therefore normal for a Konkomba to say that <q>Kinakuɔk has spoken</q> – meaning, <q>Ubɔr has spoken.</q></gloss></item>
