            <projectDesc>The project focuses on digitising oral folktales from Ghana, specifically the Konkomba people, through different media.
                The project puts a body of oral folktales into writing and eventually makes them available as annotated, digitised narratives.
                It thus aims to make a contribution to visibilising this culture, which through processes of colonisation, the accompanying priviledging of written/print culture and Eurocentric/Western thinking has been marginalised.</projectDesc>

        <head type="mainTitle"> A MAN SHOULD LOVE HIS WIVES EQUALLY </head>
        <p>(As told by Uninkpel Gmasimboon at Chakping, Ghana on 16/03/2022)</p>
        <div type="introduction">
         <head type="subTitle"> Introduction </head>
         <p>The story below calls into question the ability of a man to love all his wives equally in a polygamous marriage. The story presents the political head of an unidentified Konkomba community who marries three wives but does not love them equally. However, the wife that eventually gives him the greatest joy, though short-lived, is the very wife he loathes. As the narrator states at the end of his narrative, the story condemns discrimination while promoting unconditional love for all, especially in polygamous homes.</p>

            <p><q>My story goes like this …,</q> Gmasimboon announces to his audience.</p>
            <p><q>Ehen!</q> responds the audience, after which the storyteller proceeds thus:</p>
            <p>There once lived a certain <term ref="#gloss3">ubɔr</term> who had more than one wife. Unfortunately, he did not love one of them as he did the others. One day, he sent the wife he disliked to fetch water from the river. When the woman got to the river, she found something called <term ref="#gloss1">kijabakr</term>.</p>
            <p>On seeing the woman, the thing said: <q>Touch me and find out what happens.</q> The woman obliged and brushed the thing with a stick, whereupon the thing started singing::</p>
            <p><hi ref="italic">(But before the storyteller can intone the song, one of his audience chips in with some information the storyteller omitted:)</hi></p>
            <p><q>Meanwhile <term ref="#gloss3">ubɔr</term> had sent the woman to fetch water so that he could take his bath and sit in council,</q>the audience points out.</p>
            <p><hi ref="italic">(The storyteller welcomes this additional information and integrates it into his narration as follows:)</hi></p>
            <p>All this while that the woman was at the river, <term ref="#gloss3">ubɔr</term> was waiting in the <term ref="#gloss2">kinakuɔk</term> for her to return with water so that he could take his bath and sit in council. Now, when the woman touched the thing, it broke into song:</p>
            <p><hi ref="italic">(The storyteller intones the song and his audience join in.)</hi></p>

     <label>kinakuɔk:</label><item><gloss xml:id="gloss2">a round room that serves as the main entrance to a typical Konkomba house. It has two doors at both ends to serve as the passage in or out of a house. It also serves as a place for relaxing or hosting visitors/guests. In ubɔr’s palace, kinakuɔk usually has a stage or a raised platform where ubɔr sits to hold meetings and perform other functions. Thus, kinakuɔk can assume political significance rather than being a mere passage or a place for hanging out or playing host to visitors. Within this political context, kinakuɔk can be used as a synonym or a metonym (in literary speech) for ubɔr or the authority of ubɔr. It is therefore normal for a Konkomba to say that <q>Kinakuɔk has spoken</q> – meaning, <q>Ubɔr has spoken.</q></gloss></item>
