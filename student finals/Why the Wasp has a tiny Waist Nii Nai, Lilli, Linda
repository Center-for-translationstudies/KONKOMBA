                    The project puts a body of oral folktales into writing and eventually makes them available as annotated, digitized narratives. It thus aims to make a contribution to visibilising this

                <p>(As told by Waja Ngnalbu on 21st February 2020 in Chamba, Ghana)</p>

            <div><head type="subTitle">Introduction</head>
                <p>The following story relates how the wasp's self-exile from his community eventually deformed him. It presents the wasp as a loner who refuses to participate 
                in communal activities and thus incurs the wrath of his kith and kin. The story, grounded in the communal spirit of Konkomba funerals (particularly 
                the <term xml:id="gloss1">kinachuŋ</term> cultural dance), celebrates teamwork and depicts the centrality of communal living among Konkombas. The storyteller 
                makes this clear at the outset of his narrative when he commences his tale with its moral lesson before relating the tale itself.</p>

                <p>Waja then continues:</p> 
                <p>It is important to participate in communal activities with others whenever the occasion arises. Once upon a time, there lived a wasp and his kin. 
                   They lived together with other members of the community in peace and unity. The wasp however decided to be a loner, excluding himself from all communal           
                   activities. He neither attended any funeral nor participated in any <term xml:id="gloss2">nkpaawiin</term>. One day the wasp received news about the demise           
                   of his in-law and had to leave for the funeral. Unfortunately, because he had not been attending other people's funerals, no one wanted to accompany him to           
                   his in-law's funeral. Left with no other option, he decided to go alone, carrying with him all the instruments needed to perform the <term xml:id="gloss3">njeen</term>           
                   and <term xml:id="gloss1">kinachuŋ</term>: he picked up the <term xml:id="gloss4">ligangaln</term>; he tied <term xml:id="gloss5">tibaln</term> around his ankles; 
                   he strapped the <term xml:id="gloss6">kiloŋ</term> to one shoulder; he slung an axe over the other shoulder; he picked up his uduun in his hand; he tied all the 
                   other <term xml:id="gloss7">tinachinchen</term> around his waist and hit the road running.<term xml:id="note1"> <hi rend="superscript">1</hi></term> As he 
                   journeyed, he sang this song:</p>

               <p>From a distance, his in-laws heard the singing and drumming and speculated that the wasp, and perhaps his kin, were arriving. 
                  Some of them remarked sarcastically, in reaction to the wasp's appearance at the funeral grounds-the first of its kind-that: 
                  "<term xml:id="gloss8">Bo</term>! Today the wasp is coming; the earth will explode." Out of curiosity they rushed out and fixed 
                  their eyes in the direction of the singing and drumming. The wasp soon emerged, staggering under the weight of all the <term xml:id="gloss1">kinachuŋ</term> 
                  musical instruments he was carrying and playing. On helping him take the musical instruments off his body, the wasp's in-laws discovered that 
                  the <term xml:id="gloss7">tinachinchen</term> around his waist had compressed his waist into a tiny size. All their efforts to get his waist 
                  to return to its normal size proved futile.</p>

                            literally but nonsensically translates: "and he fell on the road going. Its closest English equivalent is "to hit the road." But because 
                            the English equivalent does not capture the sense of urgency and enthusiasm suggested in the Likpakpaln idiom, I introduced this enthusiasm 
                            by adding the word "running" from the English idiom, "to hit the ground running," which suggests an enthusiastic start to an activity but 
                            does not mean to set off on a journey. To therefore communicate the idea of the wasp setting off energetically/enthusiastically, I had to 
                            amalgamate the above English idioms into, "... and hit the road running."</gloss></p>

                               variously as dondo, tama, dundun, kalungu, or lunna across West Africa, it is usually placed under the armpit and struck with a stick to produce music. 
                               One can change the pitch or tone of the sound by compressing and releasing the strings connecting the two skin coverings at both ends. This makes kiloŋ 
                               suitable for use as a talking drum in some West African cultures.</gloss></item>

                            and grow as tall as my grandfather's male Kapok tree." This is one of the numerous ways in which a Konkomba storyteller can end his/her story. 
                            This particular type of ending suggests that Konkombas believe that storytelling (or entertainment in the broader sense) has health benefits, 
                            especially healthy physical growth. The association of storytelling with physical growth is so entrenched in Konkomba belief system that it is 
                            even believed that when a child engages in storytelling at daytime-for Konkomba storytelling sessions are held normally in the evenings after 
                            supper/dinner-he or she will have stunted growth. Also, the reference to the grandfather's male Kapok tree in this type of ending points to the 
                            patriarchal nature of traditional Konkomba society.</gloss></item>

                            when one has a lot of farm work, is building, flooring or roofing a house, shelling maize/corn, cracking groundnuts, or thrashing guinea corn among other
